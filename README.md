# Fiery-Kirby
Here is a platformer game with Kirby as main character which I made from scratch. Built using [Libdgx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and designed using [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/).

Compatible with Android/iOS/Desktop and web

Level demo https://youtu.be/vU91DTM5uts

## Features
With this game, you can:

* Blast awful crab enemies to smithereens

* Have the cutest looking kirby jumping around your screen

* Avoid getting hit, or its curtains for kirby

* Defeat all enemies to escape in a flying portal

* The best part: Game logic has been separated from world design. Now anyone can design their own level.
